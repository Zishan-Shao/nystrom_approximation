## Descriptions of Experiment Datasets

NOTE: there will be both benchmarking real datasets and synthetic datasets in the folder

**Real**: abalone.txt, pyrim_scale.txt, 
**Synthetic**: 

For BDCD, it would be great if the datasets are long and thin (m >> n) because then the case studied are always low ranked matrices. 

For BCD, the datasets efficient to be used are short and fat (n >> n)

For square fighters (m == n), good luck buddy, trust in you :->>>>


### Real Datasets
(Mostly from libsvm: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/)

#### pyrim_scale.txt (extremely small)
Source: UCI / Qualitative Structure Activity Relationships
data: 74
features: 27
Files:
- pyrim
- pyrim_scale (scaled to [-1,1])


#### abalone_scale (small, tall)
Source: UCI / Abalone
data: 4,177
features: 8
Files:
- abalone
- abalone_scale (scaled to [-1,1])
